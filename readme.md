# Tetris

I got a sudden desire to implement Tetris. I attempted to implement it in 4 hours, but then I discovered that rotating pieces in Tetris is more complicated than expected. In the end, it took around two days.

# Controls

Move the tetriminos with the arrow keys and rotate them using R and T.

# Backend

This was built in my game engine, [Varkor](https://github.com/Underdisc/Varkor). In fact, it's the first real game that's been built using the engine. Hilariously, it doesn't use many of the features provided by the engine. It does, however, demonstrate a project that is completely decoupled from the engine's source.
